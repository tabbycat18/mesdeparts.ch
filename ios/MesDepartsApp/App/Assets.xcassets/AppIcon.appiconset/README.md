# App Icon Placeholders

`AppIcon.appiconset` already declares all required iPhone/iPad/App Store icon slots in `Contents.json`.

Before App Store submission, replace placeholders with branded PNG assets for each required slot:

- iPhone: 20pt, 29pt, 40pt, 60pt at 2x and 3x
- iPad: 20pt, 29pt, 40pt at 1x and 2x
- iPad: 76pt at 1x and 2x
- iPad Pro: 83.5pt at 2x
- App Store marketing icon: 1024x1024 at 1x

Notes:

- Do not include alpha transparency in final icon PNGs.
- Keep one consistent visual design across all sizes.
- Ensure the 1024x1024 icon is production-quality before uploading to App Store Connect.
